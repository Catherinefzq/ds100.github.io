# __Motivation__

Suicide is a leading cause of death in the US. Suicide rates increased in nearly every state from 1999 through 2016. Mental health conditions are often seen as the cause of suicide, but suicide is rarely caused by any single factor. In fact, many people who died by suicide are not known to have a diagnosed mental health condition at the time of death. We are interested in examining the variations of suicide death rates among different categorical variables such as gender, race, age group, and to test if the observed differences are statistically significant combined with the analysis to suicide death rate and related confidence interval.

# __Related work__

Suicide has ranked as the 10th leading cause of death among Americans for many years. 
Here is the link for report that inspired us. https://afsp.org/about-suicide/suicide-statistics/ 
This report summarizes the suicide rates by race and age. In addition, they also include the most common suicide methods and data for suicide attempt.

# __Research Questions__

The initial thought of this project is to discover the relationship between suicide and people's mental status. We have found two separated datasets, in which one is the Injury Mortality data in the US, the other contains people's depression status in the US. Since both of the two datasets contain information for age, race, and gender, we decided to compare the trend of suicide death rates with depression prevalence under these three categories.

# __Data Sources__

We include two datasets in our project.

### _BRFSS Prevalence Data (2011 to present)_

Data from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) Prevalence Data (2011 to present) were accessed from [cdc.gov.](https://chronicdata.cdc.gov/Behavioral-Risk-Factors/Behavioral-Risk-Factor-Surveillance-System-BRFSS-P/dttw-5yxu) BRFSS is a continuous, state-based surveillance system that collects information about modifiable risk factors for chronic diseases and other leading causes of death. The version of the data that we will use in this analysis can be found in our [Github repository](https://github.com/Catherinefzq/ds100.github.io/tree/master/data).

### _NCHS - Injury Mortality: United States_

Data from the NCHS - Injury Mortality: United States were accessed from [data.cdc.gov.](https://data.cdc.gov/NCHS/NCHS-Injury-Mortality-United-States/nt65-c7a7) 
This dataset describes injury mortality in the United States beginning in 1999. Two concepts are included in the circumstances of an injury death: intent of injury and mechanism of injury. In our project, we focus on intent of injury, specifically suicide. Data are based on information from all resident death certificates filed in the 50 states and the District of Columbia.

# __Analyses__

## Data Visualizations

We explore our data by race, gender, and age. Our findings are include in the [dashboards](dashboard.html).

By age, we found people from 25-64 has a high prevalence of depression which is consistent with the suicide death rate. However, age group '65+' having a relative low depression prevalence, their suicide rate remains relatively high.

By race, Non-Hispanic White people have both high depression prevalence as well as suicide rate.

By gender, female tend to have a higher depression prevalence than male. However, their suicide rate is much lower than that of male. 

## Statistical Analysis

Based on our data, we built 4 models, including three simple linear regression models for BRFSS dataset and one multiple linear regression model for NCHS Injury Mortality dataset. 

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = F)
library(tidyverse)

```


```{r, message = FALSE}
brfss_data = read_csv("./data/brfss_data.csv") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names()
injury_data = read_csv("./data/NCHS_-_Injury_Mortality__United_States.csv") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names()

new_injury = 
  injury_data %>% 
  filter(injury_mechanism == "All Mechanisms",
         injury_intent == "Suicide",
         year  %in%  c(2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016),
         age_group_years != "All Ages",
         race != "All races",
         sex != "Both sexes") %>%
  mutate(suicide_dr = (deaths / population) * 100000,
         age_group_years = str_replace(age_group_years, "< 15", "<25"),
         age_group_years = str_replace(age_group_years,"15–24", "<25"),
         age_group_years = str_replace(age_group_years,"65–74", "65+"),
         age_group_years = str_replace(age_group_years,"75+", "65")) %>% 
  select(year, sex, age_group_years, race, suicide_dr) %>% 
  mutate(sex = as.factor(ifelse(sex == "Male", 0, 1)),
         race = as.factor(race),
         age_group_years = as.factor(age_group_years),
         year = as.factor(year))
```

### Model 1
__Model 1:__ Suicide Death Rate = 8.334 - 12.565 I{sex = female} - 0.912 I{race = Non-Hispanic black} + 10.313 I{race = Non-Hispanic white} + 7.475 I{25 < age < 44} + 7.531 I{45 < age < 64} + 6.362 I{age >= 65}

```{r}
fit_suicide = lm(suicide_dr ~ sex + race + age_group_years + year, data = new_injury)
summary(fit_suicide) %>% 
  broom::tidy() %>% 
  select(term, estimate, p.value) %>%
  mutate(term = str_replace(term, "^sex", "sex: "),
         term = str_replace(term, "^race", "race: "),
         term = str_replace(term, "^age_group_years", "age group years: "),
         term = str_replace(term, "^year", "year: ")) %>% 
  knitr::kable(digits = 3)

```


### Model 2
__Model 2(Age):__ Depression Rate = 16.486 + 2.31 I{25 < age < 44} + 4.528 I{45 < age < 64} - 2.125 I{age >= 65}


### Model 3

__Model 3(Gender):__ Depression Rate = 13.66 + 9.028 I{gender = female}


### Model 4

__Model 4(Race):__ Depression Rate = 17.511 - 1.716 I{race = Black, non-Hispanic} + 1.901 I{race = White, non-Hispanic}

# __Conclusion__

Depression is an insufficient and unnecessary causal factor for suicide, we see similar trend for the three groups (age, race, gender) with some exceptions. Overall, suicide death rate and depression prevalence do vary among the three proposed factors. However, the direct association between depression and suicide may be difficult to test. For rare cases like suicide, case-control study should be a suitable way to conduct the research, while the psychological status like depression are really complicated to detect, especially for suicide cases.
